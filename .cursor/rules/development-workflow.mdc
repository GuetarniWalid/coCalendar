# Development Workflow Guidelines

## Problem-Solving Approach
- **Think deeply** - Re-verify solutions before declaring them finished
- **Ask clarifying questions** if explanations are unclear
- **Avoid rebuilding loops** - Take time to understand the problem fully first
- **Read documentation thoroughly** - Verify changes against library documentation before declaring fixes complete

## Command Execution
- **Automatic terminal commands** - Run commands via terminal automatically rather than instructing manual UI actions
- **No manual steps** - Automate wherever possible

## Git and Version Control
- **Clean commits** - Keep git history clean and meaningful
- **Proper .gitignore** - Ensure all unnecessary files are ignored
- **Node modules** - Always ignore node_modules at all levels (`node_modules/` and `**/node_modules/`)

## File Management
- **Edit existing files** - Always prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- **No unnecessary files** - Don't create files unless absolutely necessary
- **No proactive documentation** - Only create documentation files (*.md) when explicitly requested

## Package Management
- **Workspace structure** - Use npm workspaces as defined in [app/package.json](mdc:app/package.json)
- **Package naming** - Use `@project/package-name` convention
- **Dependencies** - Keep dependencies in appropriate package.json files

## Testing and Quality
- **Fix linter errors** - Address linting issues when they're introduced
- **Don't loop excessively** - Stop after 3 attempts to fix linter errors and ask for guidance
- **Type safety** - Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance
